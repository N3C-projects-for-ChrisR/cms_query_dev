# combine_piecemeal
This is the combine.sql script broken into pieces with the hope of making debugging easier. 
Since the intermediate steps have been promotes to full tables, they are there to making
querying those steps easier. Hope it helps, despite the redundancy with the combined combine.sql script up one directory.

## scripts in order:

- combine_date_numbers.sql
- combine_range_numbers.sql
- combine_tagged_rows.sql
- combine_end_rows.sql
- combine_start_rows.sql
- combine_ranges.sql
